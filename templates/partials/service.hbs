                                means a storyteller. So now you can understand that one who does kathak, tells a story
                                by dancing using his/her fingers, gestures, posters, and expressions but what type of
                                story do they tell? These storytellers communicated stories from the great epics and
                                ancient mythology. They tell the childhood stories of Hindu god Krishna in the courts of
                                North Indian kingdoms. </p>
