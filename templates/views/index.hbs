                        <p>Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for
                        the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the
                        movement itself.
                        <p>Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful
                        performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who
                        feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful
                        impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are
                        the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In
                        dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither
                        can exist without the other.</p>
